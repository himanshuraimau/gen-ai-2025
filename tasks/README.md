## Learning Path Recommendations

### Beginner Path
If you're new to GenAI:
1. Focus on Modules 1-3 first
2. Complete the Website Bot project as your first end-to-end application
3. Get comfortable with prompt engineering before diving into fine-tuning

### Intermediate Path
If you have some GenAI experience:
1. Start with Module 2, but review Module 1 concepts as needed
2. Focus on the Legal Document Assistant and Chart Builder projects
3. Explore Module 5 for deeper model customization

### Advanced Path
For experienced AI developers:
1. Quickly review Modules 1-3 fundamentals
2. Deep-dive into Modules 5B-8
3. Take on the Content Creation Studio and Evaluation Dashboard projects
4. Consider contributing your own extensions to the projects
