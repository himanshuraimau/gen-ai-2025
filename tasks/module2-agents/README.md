# Module 2: Building AI Agents & Workflows

## Overview
This module focuses on creating autonomous AI agents that can perform complex tasks by chaining together multiple capabilities and interacting with external tools.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the LangChain framework for building agent workflows
- Create agents that can use tools and APIs
- Implement memory systems for persistent conversations
- Design effective agentic workflows

## Tasks

### Task 1: LangChain Basics
- Set up LangChain with different LLM providers
- Create simple chains for text processing
- Implement sequential chains for multi-step reasoning
- Build a document summarization pipeline

### Task 2: Building Tool-Using Agents
- Create custom tools for your agent (calculator, search, etc.)
- Implement an agent that can select appropriate tools
- Design a research assistant that searches for information
- Test the agent with complex multi-step queries

### Task 3: Working with APIs
- Create tools that call external APIs
- Build an agent that can:
  - Check weather forecasts
  - Look up stock prices
  - Search for news articles
  - Summarize web content
- Implement error handling for API interactions

### Task 4: Agent Memory Systems
- Implement different memory types:
  - Buffer memory
  - Summary memory
  - Conversation history
- Create a persistent memory system using Qdrant
- Build an agent that remembers user preferences

### Task 5: Human-in-the-Loop Workflows
- Design agents that know when to ask for human help
- Implement approval workflows for critical actions
- Create a collaborative document editing assistant
- Build a system for handling feedback and corrections

### Task 6: Advanced Agent Project
- Create a trip planning agent that:
  - Finds flights and accommodations
  - Suggests activities based on user preferences
  - Remembers past trips
  - Provides estimated costs
  - Generates an itinerary document
