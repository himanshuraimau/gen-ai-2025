# Module 4: Multi-Modal & Context-Aware AI

## Overview
This module explores working with multiple modalities (text, images) and building systems that maintain contextual awareness through knowledge graphs.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand multi-modal LLM capabilities
- Build applications that analyze both text and images
- Implement graph-based knowledge systems
- Create context-aware AI applications

## Tasks

### Task 1: Multi-Modal LLM Basics
- Set up GPT-4 Vision or Claude 3 Vision
- Create a basic image analysis system
- Build a comparison of different multi-modal models
- Implement image + text prompt templates

### Task 2: Image Analysis Applications
- Create an image captioning system
- Build a visual question answering application
- Implement OCR with multi-modal LLMs
- Create a data extraction system from screenshots

### Task 3: Document Analysis with Vision
- Build a system to analyze:
  - Charts and graphs
  - Tables in images
  - Forms and invoices
  - Diagrams and flowcharts
- Create structured data output from visual inputs

### Task 4: Neo4j Knowledge Graph Setup
- Install and configure Neo4j
- Create a basic knowledge graph schema
- Implement data ingestion into the graph
- Write basic Cypher queries

### Task 5: LLM + Knowledge Graph Integration
- Create LLM functions to query knowledge graphs
- Build an agent that can update the knowledge graph
- Implement relationship extraction from text
- Create visualizations of the knowledge graph

### Task 6: Context-Aware Assistant
- Build an assistant that:
  - Maintains user context in a knowledge graph
  - Handles multi-turn conversations with context
  - Can switch between different topics
  - Remembers user preferences and past interactions
  - Uses both text and image understanding

### Task 7: Image + Graph Multi-Modal Application
- Create an application that:
  - Analyzes images of products/people/places
  - Stores information in a knowledge graph
  - Allows queries across both modalities
  - Enables exploration of relationships
  - Provides visual results with explanations
